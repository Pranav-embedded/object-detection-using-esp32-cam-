# ESP32-CAM Object Detection using Edge Impulse (with OLED)

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using the **ESP32-CAM** module and **Edge Impulse**.
The system is trained to detect objects like **onion, potato, and tomato**, and displays detection results via **Serial Monitor and OLED display**.

##  Hardware Connections

### ESP32-CAM Programming Connections

| ESP32-CAM | FTDI                       |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| 5V        | 5V                         |
| GND       | GND                        |
| U0R       | TX                         |
| U0T       | RX                         |
| GPIO0     | GND *(Only during upload)* |

 **Important**

* GPIO0 must be connected to **GND while uploading**
* Remove GPIO0-GND after upload for normal operation
